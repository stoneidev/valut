This conversation took place on 1월 10 2024.


Speaker:  22:08
For people who are working in customer support or carrying out other important business processes that customers depend on.


Speaker:  22:08
And so in the context of modernization?


Speaker:  22:08
I guess the first question is, can we do modernization work without disrupting those people? And I think the first, the first area to look at is.


Speaker:  22:08
When we talk about modernizing the architecture, are we also talking about modernizing how they work, the tools that they use?


Speaker:  22:08
Will the interface change still come across people who are using green screen mainframes?


Speaker:  22:09
And so modernization is going to end up changing that, not just the UI moving, telling web-based, maybe an iPad app and so.


Speaker:  22:09
When the user experience change is so big.


Speaker:  22:09
I think avoiding disruption is going to be pretty difficult, if not impossible, I think, in those kind of situations.


Speaker:  22:09
Sometimes there's an idea and I think it's important to, you know, really address this early that.


Speaker:  22:09
There's going to be a seamless switch over. We've got this horrible old legacy system. We'll just build a new system.


Speaker:  22:09
New UI, new features, new workflow, everything We go home on Friday using the mainframe.


Speaker:  22:09
And we come back on Monday using this nice shiny new UI doesn't really work that way because that can often take.


Speaker:  22:09
Months or years?


Speaker:  22:10
Recording and progress. Three. So the modernization might not finish.


Speaker:  22:10
So I think just to summarize my thoughts on this one, I think the first step is to really.


Speaker:  22:10
Spend time with the end users. Have people in your team who know how to do product discovery. Product people, UX people, service design people.


Speaker:  22:10
Get you know, go deep into that area 1st and make sure people understand how revolutionary this user experience change will be.


Speaker:  22:10
And the second part I think is.


Speaker:  22:11
I don't like to talk about big design upfront, like, you know, planning this three-year project, But I do think it's important to be realistic about what might this migration look like, When might things be in parallel or when might it be finished.


Speaker:  22:11
And I think at that point it does take a lot of in depth analysis. It does require thinking about what the future state looks like. So it's it's important to get the balance right, not doing too much out of our thinking.


Speaker:  22:11
But then being able to present and socialize this, this migration path and highlighting look, we're going to have this dual run phase where people might use two products and if we stop modernization halfway through, we're going to be stuck with two. I think it's important to be you know getting a balance of enthusiastic about this new change, but getting across the realities of.


Speaker:  22:11
There will be some disruption.


Speaker:  22:12
It's going to be expected, but we can minimize it. If we're honest about what's achievable and what it takes. I think I'll stop talking. I was talking for ages and I'll let someone else talk. Now things are kicking us up, Nick. It's all my head nodding. And no others have had this experience as well as there anyone else who wants to take this one as well?


Speaker:  22:12
Oh, I love this one, especially 'cause I can say plus one to everything that Nick just said to begin with, but I I work predominantly in big digital information systems or combination of digital and and not systems.


Speaker:  22:12
And what we mean by modernization isn't, Oh yeah, now we can use Kafka, now we can use Kubernetes, now we can decouple the front end and use view and React. I mean that is that's part of it. But what we mean is that the world has changed around us. The paradigm has shifted.


Speaker:  22:13
And so often when people mean, when people are saying modernization, they say, oh, I read this really good book, Team Topologies and now I want to reorganize the team. Or yeah, we can use Kubernetes and write 300 micro services and it'll all just work fine and great and we'll have the weekends off again and again. That's part of it. But for me, the design aspect, the architecture aspect is really understanding what mental models and structures and shape of information.


Speaker:  22:13
Has changed that. We built many, many, many bazillion pieces of software to deliver information to a browser with the mental model of a page right out of the encyclopedias we had on the shelf when I was a kid. Same mental model.


Speaker:  22:13
That doesn't work if you wanna ask Alexa a question.


Speaker:  22:14
From somewhere inside that content. And so all the modernization tools, microservices and all the things that we're using, they really are just helping us reshape.


Speaker:  22:14
The core information, the purpose and the relationships between the software parts. I mean we even use software to structure the infrastructure in which we build software right in the turtles all the way down and software all the way down. And so modernization for me is a shift to looking at the paradigm shift and also looking at relationships as opposed to.


Speaker:  22:15
Designing a single piece of software that meets all the requirements for an organization. Cause in my world, there is no one piece of software anymore that doesn't exist. And so how do you make relationships emergent and and vibrant? And it's surprising because this seems really obvious to me, but there's a lot of pushback on this. We love our crowd applications. We love them, we love them so much. And that's good. Sometimes they're the right.


Speaker:  22:15
Solution. But this this change really isn't the software. It's us.


Speaker:  22:15
We're the ones who are changing and we are the hard things to change. The software is not really as hard as the people systems. I think so also said too much, but this was our favorite question.


Speaker:  22:15
This question, yeah. I think, Elizabeth, you and I have had our share fair share of green screens. And also, no, you can't go talk to them because they're over there. Can you talk a little bit about what it's like to work in government and civic tech and and what is Mars modernization and a legacy perspective in government?


Speaker:  22:16
I mean it it's all modernization like that is most of what people say they want to do. And I think one of the reasons they like to say that is that nobody can argue with modernization. So you can have whatever actual goals you have and put it under some word that everyone can like superficially agree to, but then like, you know, push off all the real disagreements that are coming later. And yeah, I think everyone's hoping in government that it will be like a technical thing.


Speaker:  22:16
To somebody else and therefore not have to think about it and everybody will come back. It's just perfect thing like Nick was saying the Friday to Monday training that was happening.


Speaker:  22:16
And unfortunately, that just doesn't actually happen, at least in the government systems. That just never really pans out. And I think one of the challenges is, you know, because of that separation.


Speaker:  22:17
The transformation doesn't actually get like the backing it needs from the actual decision makers and from the programs that are trying to use that software. And so I think, you know, I question the premises original question a little bit about the, you know, trying not to disrupt anybody. I think we actually need to lean into that a little bit and try to lean into the value it's delivering rather than trying like, oh, you won't notice a thing, don't worry, it's all these things. Instead of that, like try to pin it to the new value people are gonna get and therefore be able to make some space for and do some storytelling around the inevitable disruption.


Speaker:  22:17
Umm, so yeah, sorry to I, it's, it is a good question. I hear it a lot. But I think if we can pivot that over to like value delivery instead, I think that doesn't run a lot of good.


Speaker:  22:17
I'm going to take an audience question. So the question is talking about modernization, but should they take an incremental approach, Should they take a Big Bang approach? Nikki said a little bit earlier. Not trying to do all the thinking up front which would be required for a big thing, but there any thoughts on on how to actually approach something fairly large?


Speaker:  22:17
Yeah, I can have a go at it. So I work at the company and this was.


Speaker:  22:18
A large, a really, really large decade full of system and it had many, many parts and including mainframe stuff, right? So how do you modernize something like that? And the company that I worked for before I joined, like they had attended a rewrite.


Speaker:  22:18
And that rewrite took them several years.


Speaker:  22:18
And it was a it was like a lot of like domain knowledge like in the industry.


Speaker:  22:18
Trying to make all of those happens while like building new feature requests for their clients. They were trying to do both and So what ended up was like after many years when they tried to actually onboard a client onto the new system, it didn't work. And that was like a very hard lesson after spending years of investments and finding out that it didn't work so.


Speaker:  22:19
When when I joined, we were trying to figure out like how do we take this forward. And so one of the questions was like OK, what do our users need? And our users were been dealing with like these like basically you know, back in the day you were filling out paper forms and if you can imagine like you know.


Speaker:  22:19
Like a really long foodscape paper of a form shoved into like a ASP web form that pretty much you had to fill out all the details. That's how the user interface was. And so as a user, as a client of the system, they were like, hey, this is so hard to use. When, when are you guys going to give me something better to use? And maybe when I'm solving that problem. So what we ended up doing was we actually worked with a.


Speaker:  22:19
UX based company and we worked with like you know what are the.


Speaker:  22:20
Use of flows and how can we do this. And so we ended up in nine months coming together a really task based user interface and like trying to add APIs like that can still talk to the old system. So it was still all mainframe things in the back, but we were able to do this sort of modernization and like unblocking our users. So that was like you know one approach.


Speaker:  22:20
And then internally we like also what was good was happening in that project was sort of like an incremental modernization. So that was like in the mainframe world, IBM charges a lot of money. There was Tuxedo that was like you know, lots of lots and lots of fees. These are one of the thing was like how can we get rid of this. And so they introduced a message queue, it was like VMM queue, but that reduced the need to work with tuxedos. So there were there were things that were being done.


Speaker:  22:21
Incrementally without like, you know, stopping the whole entire process and still adding values. So these are some ways where incremental monetization can work of course.


Speaker:  22:21
It's a, it's a. It depends on the type of monetization that you are after.


Speaker:  22:21
So in other cases that might not work and maybe you should ask yourself, do we even need to modernize this? Is there a SAS product or something out there that's now doing the job for us, in which case your modernization is probably getting rid of your legacy application in in trying to move to something that's available to the market. So those are the two, I guess, things that I can think of from my experience.


Speaker:  22:22
Yeah, I think you you've you've uh, touched on something interesting there that modernization means so many different things to different people. I've heard of modernization where I've taken my paper PDF's, I've turned them into fillable PDF's. Aha, I've modernized this process now. But I've also heard of really interesting incremental modernizations where you've taken DV2 on the mainframe and IVMMQ on the mainframe and moved it to the cloud and actually that unlocked a lot is now a lot of your.


Speaker:  22:22
Your source of truth is now moved to the cloud. Now you have so many new optimizations and new.


Speaker:  22:22
Start now. Optimizations can do opportunities that you didn't have before when you're kind of Eric out from the cloud.


Speaker:  22:22
A couple of you touched on UX service designers. I love it when you get involved. When those folks get involved, because it's kind of the intersection of knowledge and systems.


Speaker:  22:22
But I want to ask how do you leverage the experience of others, particularly non-technical SMEs when designing and modernizing systems. And you know then you touched upon this a little bit too about you know it's it's the people and processes right, the technology is oftentimes third.


Speaker:  22:23
But I'd love to hear any examples you might have. But let me start with Ryan. I would love to hear what you have to say. Sure. So absolutely I look around. Typically I look for domain experts.


Speaker:  22:23
Absolutely. When I'm looking, who knows the business, who knows how things work separate from the systems and the calls. Who knows how actually you know value flows to an organization and and then storming. I use them a lot.


Speaker:  22:23
Often also, once I'm looking at what am I Bounded context and message flows between bounded context, I'm looking to them for the languages.


Speaker:  22:24
To drive and what is what is that ubiquitous language. The different contexts have different terms for the same thing do they are the terms overloaded So I leverage an alt and that's not the the technical sort of team designers are another great 1:00. We we have designers I lead designers designers especially everywhere from an event storming to really understanding the current state of the systems. I mean for most people the screen is the system that they don't see beyond that right. And so if that's the system and we're focused on people.


Speaker:  22:24
Then that's a natural place to start, and many systems have been built by engineers who I love them, but they're pretty horrible.


Speaker:  22:24
At at at building and interactions and the screens and so I will leverage designers not just to make it pretty but.


Speaker:  22:24
Think through What does a human need? What information do they need to make a decision here? How's that information presented? What are their options?


Speaker:  22:25
And so we leverage a lot of designers, not just as it comes to design, but really understanding how information needs to flow through it. And then finally I'll look for, I had one company that hired me in to help them improve their system and it was a back to India as a mainframe, old mainframe system. And the way they went about it, they would have the banking system. They hired bankers, taught them COBOL and they built the system well. They wanted to redo everything in Java. And so they hired us and me and spent the first two days they said can you teach them in Java? And we wanted to teach them how to do the system. And after the first day, I said this is just not going to work. I can't teach them.


Speaker:  22:25
Enough Java, but we said is what if we taught them to be analysts?


Speaker:  22:25
On the new systems, where will we tell them how to do user stories and acceptance criteria And it worked perfectly because they understood the insurance and outs of things you know, like you know loans and and and payment schedules and those sort of things. And yet they could be productive because the new group of engineers that came in did not have that background domain experience. And so we were able to leverage them in becoming analysts. But absolutely I think cast a wide net early on on for folks.


Speaker:  22:25
It also you also create relationships with these people and doing that one that you're going to lean on later on.


Speaker:  22:25
When it comes to the sort of, you know, giving feedback on design.


Speaker:  22:26
Thanks so much Ryan. Any others thoughts on that topic? I have the humble story that I wanted to share about this, that early on in a big modernization, digital transformation, multi millions of dollars initiative I'm starting and geeking out. You know I'm doing all the like all the geek stuff you're supposed to do and someone working with me who's not on the tech team made me go watch.


Speaker:  22:26
The people using the system and who had been using it for a long time and made me just watch them do their job.


Speaker:  22:26
And it was unbelievably transformative to my own approach because they'd had this legacy system for so long. Every single one of the 15 people that I watched, you know, watched like the senior people used it so differently that there actually was 15 different systems because they had all these hacks and workarounds and, you know, so understanding.


Speaker:  22:27
The software system would never have helped me.


Speaker:  22:27
Understand what people needed and what they were doing. And so I wouldn't resist that again, I would I'd, I'd volunteer now to do that.


Speaker:  22:27
Great. Thank you so much.


Speaker:  22:27
Any final thoughts on that topic before we move on?


Speaker:  22:27
Cool. So when you come into a brand new client, a brand new employer, how do you how do each of you start to familiarize yourself with those systems?


Speaker:  22:27
And maybe we're going to start with India on that one. So, you know, it's been a while since you go to New York Times, but like, what was your first month look like? Oh my God.


Speaker:  22:27
So I had to get up to speed trying to understand the home delivery business of the times. So, so.


Speaker:  22:28
There are still a lot of people who get newspapers delivered to their house and and so how this entire system works from subscription to billing payments of complex system and when I first joined.


Speaker:  22:28
Man, like there were so many documents, right? And they were like old piece meal. Oh, you should read this document. Oh, you should read that document. So it was like piles and piles of documents through. And then we we had meetings and we were trying to understand and.


Speaker:  22:28
Umm, and I thought like, hey, you know, I've learned about the event storming. Maybe I'll do event storming, but then trying to see you to do a big picture of event storming remotely when there are so many teams and managing people's calendar, It was just like a nightmare. And then the other challenge was I had to like tell my Biscuit, those people to imagine the system, tons of events like, you know, think about it and.


Speaker:  22:29
Oh, you want to name them past things and in commands and events and in, you know, we're losing people, so.


Speaker:  22:29
Had to quickly understand, well that didn't work, what else can we try? And one of the we talked a lot about like UX and service design people. We're really lucky to be working with an amazing whole group service design and design folks. And one of my colleague, she introduced the method of service programs and that was like amazing. So I've been using sequence diagrams which ties in like architectural.


Speaker:  22:29
Technical elements of like how things work and so you see this in design documents like C4 diagrams and things that are super technical.


Speaker:  22:30
But there's nothing that ties like how the user fits in. So we try to zoom in with like, OK, how do you pay? How does a person get in the newspaper today? Can we do what it says? Blueprint. And in doing so, we talk with so many small teams understood like what in what APIs are they using, what are the things that work together to do that one part. So we building that.


Speaker:  22:30
With I wanna say like just gave me so much understanding of the system.


Speaker:  22:30
And and it's of course it takes time but it was also very very useful artifact or document that we could like share in how a shared understanding of the system. So today like my go to is to figure out like you know when I go into a new project, what is the system, who are the main users of the system, what are their user needs? Not use cases, but user needs.


Speaker:  22:31
And taking and and like trying to do service so I know a catalog of what things work together to fulfill that easily. Like that's that has turned into my go to steps when understanding.


Speaker:  22:31
And look at the there's a the court I've always heard is that, umm, customers overstate hundreds of users over stakeholders. That's harder to implement in practice since the stakeholders are often paying you. But yeah, I I love that thought that you have to get out there and meet those people.


Speaker:  22:31
Can I tell you on that real quick? You know, we do a problem for Amy and we think about who are all the people intact and we organize them to three, three groups. Users are the people who directly experience the problem. They're the people who are day-to-day experience them. And then there's the customers. The customers are financially impacted.


Speaker:  22:32
By the problem, sometimes it's the same as a user's, but sometimes that's not. It's management or what have you. And then there's the stakeholders, there's sort of everybody else. But when we think about you can't, you have to pay attention to the stakeholders, but ultimately you're focused on the users, their needs like induced as and the real thing that's impacting them. But you can't lose sight of who's paying for this or who gets the financial benefit out of it. Because if you, if you don't, if you lose sight of that one, then you solve it for one set of users and you don't solve it for the other.


Speaker:  22:32
Thank you. And thoughts on how to get, how you get familiar. Nick, how do you?


Speaker:  22:32
Yourself with let's say a new client where you only have maybe six weeks end to end with an engagement.


Speaker:  22:32
Yeah, good question. For me Over the past few years, especially listening sessions I found extremely useful.


Speaker:  22:32
To the point now where trying to start every engagement with listening sessions sometimes.


Speaker:  22:33
I even said let me talk to some people from your company before I start working with them for a few reasons for that. One is get you get to understand the company a bit obviously. The other reason is you learn a lot from these sessions. Third reason is you get to practice your skills. I think it is something you can work on how to have these conversations. I've never been really good at small talk, always found it uncomfortable and weird as I've been working on that a lot over the last few years. So the basic idea is.


Speaker:  22:33
You just say, give me a list of people to talk to, give me some recommendations of who I can talk to, and you really want to get a good mix.


Speaker:  22:33
As diverse as possible could be the CEO, the CFO, customer Support solution, architects, developer.


Speaker:  22:33
Product is going to talk to various people and the goal is there is no goal.


Speaker:  22:33
You just want to have an unstructured conversation and see what happens.


Speaker:  22:33
You don't have a script if it could feel a bit awkward if you've not done this before. I do know some people who yeah, struggling with this a bit. It takes some time to develop the skills.


Speaker:  22:33
But basically, by not having an agenda, the conversation can go anywhere and this can lead to them revealing lots of insights that they might not have otherwise.


Speaker:  22:34
Umm, you can do this with two people. One person takes notes and the other ones like beating the conversation.


Speaker:  22:34
General idea you.


Speaker:  22:34
It's quite as simple really. What do people want to achieve? What problems are they facing?


Speaker:  22:34
How do they do their job? What are their plans for the future? But I find that the best conversations feel organic.


Speaker:  22:34
So you don't just walk in there and say give me your top five problems for next year. I'm going to solve all of them for you.


Speaker:  22:34
Just want to enlarge the conversation in that direction, so start with this small talk.


Speaker:  22:34
Build some rapport and then the conversation will gradually drift somewhere and you can try and take it on top it.


Speaker:  22:35
You might talk about how their week's going and they might say, oh, had so many of these support tickets. And you can say, you know, OK, is that, is this your biggest problem? Is this happening quite often or is it like just this week where things are happening? And from there you can then start shaping this conversation and stuff. So I find those listening tools are really valuable.


Speaker:  22:35
Some of these you can be a bit more technical. If you're working with like developers and architects, you know the software, then one technique I found useful there is.


Speaker:  22:35
You get them to describe the system, but you draw.


Speaker:  22:35
So they can't just, you know, explain the whole system in like 20 seconds with this diagram. That makes no sense.


Speaker:  22:35
Umm, you have to transcribe their ideas. You have to visualize what they're saying. Find out a great you, a great way to understand the system a bit more.


Speaker:  22:35
And then sometimes you have to get into the code right? You know, understanding the real complexity of a system can only be truly understood sometimes by getting into the code, seeing the technical debt, the business rules and the workflow. So you need to jump into that sometimes.


Speaker:  22:35
Alright, thanks so much. Any other closing thoughts before we trust this question? I'm still stuck on 6 weeks.


Speaker:  22:36
That I would you know and you if if it's we want to modernize our system and we want you to tell us how to do it. So here's a contract for six weeks.


Speaker:  22:36
Would tell me a lot.


Speaker:  22:36
About how they were sort of defining this thing. So for me, I think there is a lot that could happen in a short amount of time.


Speaker:  22:36
But it would need to be very focused and constructed. But the tricky thing is you'd have to know really where the leverage point is, where's the place where you could make a smallish change that would really move you towards where you're going. And that that takes time, right? Janella Meadows and Thinking and Systems talks a lot about this, that it takes time to get the beat of a system. And so I do think there's lots of ways for getting that information from the people who know it.


Speaker:  22:37
But also there's counter intuitiveness. Most of the time, an organization knows where their leverage point is, but they're pushing it in the wrong direction. They're doing the wrong thing. This is just part of how humans think in systems. And so you can you can sort of know where a problem area is, but you're gonna run into a fair amount of resistance when you try and suggest new patterns because people really think those are the patterns that are going to save them.


Speaker:  22:37
And so that's why I got stuck on six weeks. 6-6 weeks would be a very short amount of time to be confident. I think you can do it six weeks.


Speaker:  22:38
Well, I I didn't. I don't know if if like so I worked with the client for two months and so it was it wasn't. It was still a short contract, but the goal was to to help them understand the current system. And there was one person that had all of the knowledge in her rings and she was the domain expert and she knew everything and it was also a government system.


Speaker:  22:38
And and so I think one of the things I I did was what makes it have interviews with her on a regular basis. And as she would describe the system, I would try to visualize it. But the one thing that I did that was hugely valuable was like I actually recorded the conversation.


Speaker:  22:38
And then like, you know, so I would after the meeting I would go back listen to the reporting and then like fix up like you know, because it's kinda hard to listen the diagram.


Speaker:  22:38
Pretty sure I'd miss them stuff. So going back to the reporting actually helped me and so I'm finished with the space soldier or the English group of conversations was missing.


Speaker:  22:39
Interviews can be hugely helpful, but the recording was my friend.


Speaker:  22:39
Elizabeth, I don't know if you have the same experience as me, but I've gone through.


Speaker:  22:39
Policy that's thousands of days as long and you put policy and then you have the regulations and statutes that that you have to the government has to adhere to and then finally you get to systems and people and business process.


Speaker:  22:39
Let's say our problem is harder than other people's problems, but we break the law when we're not compliant with those business processes. Can you talk a little bit about your world?


Speaker:  22:40
And I mean, if anything that makes it even more important, going back to the leveraging the expertise of other people. Like you have to build your models based on the understanding of others and by all means question things and, you know, try to understand more deeply than, you know, the superficial things. You might get the first pass through, but you have to do that. And I actually find that kind of a nice constraint to understand that I cannot hold this whole system in my brain. So what is that like that group of people who can come together and actually, you know, reason about the system. So I think that's, yeah, I think it's a more complex situation, but one which actually enforces some better behaviors on that rather than trying to centralized the knowledge and feel like you can contain it.


Speaker:  22:40
Great. Thank you. Going to switch gears a little bit and go a little bit.


Speaker:  22:40
The decisions or we're picking a language technology, we could all beat up on Kafka a bit here, but what what should we be thinking about when we're we're looking at a technology that's new, not part of a legacy system and when to introduce that, what are we telling our clients and our internal stakeholders?


Speaker:  22:40
You know I wanna drop this one off.


Speaker:  22:41
Right. I think we're kicking that around. It's like when do you pick a new technology perhaps that you don't know to solve a problem and how do you know to to to do that And I think in my experience.


Speaker:  22:41
When there's a typically performance.


Speaker:  22:41
Or a qualities type of requirement that you will simply not be able to achieve with the tools that you have. You know we don't build rockets out of wood for a reason.


Speaker:  22:41
Umm. And so if I'm looking at, if you have to have a highly scalable, concurrent, et cetera, then you're probably not going to pick Python.


Speaker:  22:41
Maybe look at the pilot interpretive versus compilation, because there's worlds of differences between.


Speaker:  22:42
So that may be something, but if that's going to happen, I always challenge him to say well, how scalable, let's get it into numbers. So we're not just saying it needs to be scalable. Well, well, how scalable? By how much? By when is that a peak of an hour? Is that it's a really getting it down the numbers and then doing some sort of proof of concept around it before you go all in on, hey, we're going to do the whole thing and go and we've never learned go, but sounds good, why not, right. I do see a lot of that resume driven development which is we all want to go to learn go. We might as well go build it and go.


Speaker:  22:42
And then have developers quit and whoever comes along to inherited.


Speaker:  22:42
Now you have to go find good developers, which, umm, so I take a very cautious approach. But on a when when performance requirements necessitate that you need to there's some solution that you don't have, then then that is the appropriate time to learn and you just need to invest time to train up your team to learn new languages. That that takes time it it doesn't come overnight. And so you have to allocate that additional investment of time to help them come up to occur on whatever new technology you did.


Speaker:  22:42
Yeah, I love that. The human element to that in the kind of way you're talking about earlier. You can take someone to a certain technical level, but if their job is operations and making the systems, then proceed.


Speaker:  22:43
In the comments real quick, make sure you have security right up front too, because security will always come in to the open front card. You can't use that language because of XY and Z. And so whenever I'm going to look at the new technology, I want to go talk to the Cisco or whoever is the security people way in advance of doing anything because they often don't like it if you come to them at the end.


Speaker:  22:43
They can make your life really hard, so very true. I've also heard uh people make decisions for security though, simply because their impressions like oh Java is more secure, C# is more secure because these are enterprise languages. Thus I can't use productive boring technologies.


Speaker:  22:43
Some interesting threads I want to call out and chat. Sonia says use boring technologies. Kevin says what their teams can support both excellent points.


Speaker:  22:44
I wish I could do that in some of my cases, but those are written in global on the mainframe. So we probably don't want to modernize cobalt and cobalt. So we don't really get the opportunity sometimes there. Indeed. Do you have any thoughts on this one? Yeah, I like I think I wanted to zoom in on what Ryan said like what problem are you solving? What is this thing for? And and so in one of the cases, companies that have worked.


Speaker:  22:44
We did an architectural analysis.


Speaker:  22:44
And we had scaling bottlenecks and that was the result of temporal coupling and it was all like RPC calls and and so the need there was we have to introduce queuing and queuing was new to the company. And So what we did was we trained up people, we had the developers.


Speaker:  22:44
Joined Buddhi Dahan's course Advanced Distributed Training. Like why do we need queuing and and that first.


Speaker:  22:45
Then we, you know we introduced in service bus and the whole thing and we turned out like our OPS people like what happens when messages queue up in in you know like when the queues are getting filled up we we put in all of this upholds like poison message like you know, monitoring. So taking on new technology is not just like oh cool, I write to, I get to write and service Bus code and that's the fun part, but also all of the support things and training things that you have to do.


Speaker:  22:45
And so in that case the scaling problem, the temporal coupling, warranted it. Therefore it makes sense.


Speaker:  22:45
But like I really love what Kevin said which is like you know what can you team support and and so and and also Ryan you you touched on this if if go is the cool cool kid on the block if we all want to let you go what happens if that one person.


Speaker:  22:46
Who is the advocate of gold? Leads the team on leads the company. Then like you know who's gonna support that code? And is your only one module in Go versus all of the others are in Java. Are you gonna have this? Sort of.


Speaker:  22:46
Like you know mixed bag of things and so so that's that's something to think about. In my team we have like we have a group standard, somebody wants to introduce a new technology or a new thing first they have to come up with like what are the, what is the problem that they're trying to solve.


Speaker:  22:46
1st and then pitch it to like you know our team. And then our team gets to decide, hey, does this make sense or not so.


Speaker:  22:46
Yeah. So yeah, boring is good. Yeah, definitely be cautious.


Speaker:  22:47
You know, that Kevin brings up a really good, interesting point. How do we upscale our teams? What are some tactics? Can anyone speak to that? I mean another thing I think of example and budget or upscaling. That's really funny. I haven't seen that before.


Speaker:  22:47
In reality, but yeah, what are some what are some tactics that we could actually obscure teams? For example, if we're going from something that's on Prem and batch based, how do we do something that becomes cloud and queue based? That's a big learning curve for.


Speaker:  22:47
And it is, it is and and this is where like you know you have to talk to the business folks in the language that they understand which is like by not solving this temporal coupling and scaling issues, we can't onboard this number of customers which results in this laws or we're not able to meet our SLA which results in these compliance issues with the business, right. So This is why we have to change our systems and and so.


Speaker:  22:47
We have to be able to pitch those reasons.


Speaker:  22:48
In my case, I was able to convince my VP of architecture.


Speaker:  22:48
And in to get the support my team needed. This was back in the day so so and also what I tried to do was I I took a a very hard like a crappy problem which was all batch based and and so something happened.


Speaker:  22:48
Something goes wrong in the middle of the process. You gotta redo the whole batch. And so I wrote a small proof of concept and man, I had to show that to.


Speaker:  22:48
To the VP of Architecture to the CFO. So that demo went places and and then you know they were like oh good like OK. So this problem goes away if if we do this and so, so that's where like you know we're able to get by in. So I I think that's important.


Speaker:  22:49
If we can't convince our business stakeholders to support.


Speaker:  22:49
Umm, we don't have that support. Then it's going to be followed.


Speaker:  22:49
Great, thank you. We're going to stick with the team's theme just for a bit. What are some tools or processes, either technical or non-technical, if you found useful when working with a multi team?


Speaker:  22:49
SOA architecture. How do you make sure the service is owned by Team A? For example, can be consumed by any other team internal oils?


Speaker:  22:49
Heat takers.


Speaker:  22:49
I'm gonna call it Nick on this one.


Speaker:  22:49
Yeah, sure. Happy to jump in. So should I understand the question correctly, it's.


Speaker:  22:49
We've got some kind of distributed architecture and we might have some kind of diverse tech stack where teams work in different technologies.


Speaker:  22:49
But the whole system needs to work together somehow, so how do things integrate?


Speaker:  22:50
I think the first thing that comes to my mind is around the developer experience.


Speaker:  22:50
What I've seen in companies that try and have too much of A diverse tech stack.


Speaker:  22:50
Is that it's hard to provide a good developer experience. So what I mean there is I'm a developer. I need to build something new. Can I get this whole new application all the way to production in a couple of hours? And what that requires is everything out-of-the-box. I run a couple of commands to get my application set up. Metrics, monitoring, logging, production environment, test environments, load testing. Like all of that is just out-of-the-box and when you have too many technologies.


Speaker:  22:50
A platform team can't support all of those different tools for like 5 different tech stacks.


Speaker:  22:50
So I think the premise of having all of these different technologies of is something I would question.


Speaker:  22:50
I think a sensible default is like maybe one or two. Michael Nygard did an awesome 12 week draft conference this year.


Speaker:  22:51
About that he had to work in a company that had all these different tech stacks and he wrote, well, that's a bad idea.


Speaker:  22:51
But yeah, we have a distributed application. Things still have to communicate over the network, even if they are running on the same technologies. And I think there's again some benefits that you can get from platform thinking.


Speaker:  22:51
For example.


Speaker:  22:51
Having a standardized integration approach, it could be standardization at all in India talked about in service class.


Speaker:  22:51
Or it can be standardized standards around how services communicate, might be some Http://conventions for example.


Speaker:  22:51
So yeah, really I think it's about standards. I think it's more about the governance and ensuring that, you know, just adjusting and work independently and do whatever they want.


Speaker:  22:52
That's not allowed to run too far. I've seen quite a few examples of where that has gone too far, so I've seen about poor autonomy and there has been too much divergent.


Speaker:  22:52
So yeah, I think probably solving that issue.


Speaker:  22:52
Is more around the governance and standards having some having some groups or communities where people from different teams actually come together.


Speaker:  22:52
Do spend time together and do agree on some minimum acceptable level of.


Speaker:  22:52
Our standards and principles and ways of working and on top of once you do have those standards, you can then start to build shared libraries that bake in those standards.


Speaker:  22:52
That remove a lot of the effort from the integration as well.


Speaker:  22:52
Great, thanks. I wanna I wanna dig into a corollary there. Is there anyone else that wants to talk a little bit about how to deal with these SOA architectures?


Speaker:  22:52
I think.


Speaker:  22:53
So I've been listening and I have kind of a radical view and so if I can pause for a minute and share it. But before I do, I would say this is what how I define systems architecture. This is what drives me crazy about.


Speaker:  22:53
How we define the role, which is the expert in Kubernetes? Or we don't need one because the teams know what to do, but somebody who's focusing on relationships between the parts. And that doesn't mean telling people to do what people to do with them, but that increasingly we need people with whatever the answer to this question is.


Speaker:  22:54
We need people developing that skill set, that ability to design and develop the the patterns and practices and conceptual integrity. Fred Brooks says that conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in systems design. And he meant basically this, that if you don't have anyone who's concerned about the relationships between the Danella, Meadows says that we think because we understand one.


Speaker:  22:54
We understand. We understand 2 because one and one make 2. But we forget that we have to understand and.


Speaker:  22:54
And that what is the art and science of and what what goes there? And I think the reason I'm not giving a very specific.


Speaker:  22:54
Answer to this is it completely depends on what a particular circumstance needs, right? Like you might need somebody who is focused exclusively or predominantly on API design but that might not be the skill set needed. In a different situation it might be much more about the integration of product and platform design like and be more on that that type of thinking. So it really depends.


Speaker:  22:55
What I just I wanted to say quickly to the thing we were saying before, I have a very radical view in part because my team's always were adopting new technologies. Like right now we're developing in Flutter and Firebase and none of us have ever developed in those tools before. So it makes kind of a unique outcome. But I just wanted to interject that it confuses me too, where knowledge workers, that's what we do, we're not.


Speaker:  22:55
JavaScript developers or Java developers or front end people are that we specialize like doctors do, but organizations have really.


Speaker:  22:55
Have this idea that they can hire someone who does one thing and then that person will do that one thing for 10 years and it's bad for them to invest in anything else but technology is changes every 3 minutes. And so I think we we this whole question is a paradigm shift that we need to encourage which is that modernization is the adoption of new skills and.


Speaker:  22:56
That that it's part of what we should expect to do.


Speaker:  22:56
In our roles is to be constantly picking up new, using new tools. But I think it's also what organizations need to understand, that it is part of the investment they make in their knowledge workers.


Speaker:  22:56
Umm, but last thought what Indu said is that I was once in an architecture meeting where an architect was saying for the third time we need Kubernetes.


Speaker:  22:56
And I said why? Why do we need Kubernetes? And he said because we don't have Kubernetes.


Speaker:  22:57
That is not what I hate you like. So for teaching. Teaching us to be able to pitch why a tool is the right tool for the job, why we don't have a hammer in our toolbox. And This is why, to meet the system's goal, we need to know that like so. So we stop doing the resume driven development, Although that's fun too, and instead we can discern.


Speaker:  22:57
And show trustworthy discernment in the choice of new tools. And then also that we will learn them.


Speaker:  22:57
And we will take them up and we expect to.


Speaker:  22:57
And when I give the box, I ask people to raise their hand. How many people are coding in the same language they were five years ago? And it's never more than half the room.


Speaker:  22:58
I agree it's about skills not not roles. We often will say customers will say do you ever find an engineer, do you have a back end engineer, do you have a class like no, we have engineers. We have some that know different parts of staff but we really have engineers and then they have different skills and to be certain you know you you don't know that all and they're not interchangeable. But what we've tried to do is focus on being an engineer and then you have a certain set of skills and then what skills do you want to grow in the future. And then we have some engineers that start out quote UN quote cloud and want to go data and we have some that start out.


Speaker:  22:58
Software and want to go to data. Who doesn't want to go to be data engineer these days?


Speaker:  22:58
But I think it's really about the skills and it's a lifelong thing, you know? You want to continue to hone and grow your skills.


Speaker:  22:58
Overtime.


Speaker:  22:58
I want to take this kind of a dour direction and ask her a really hard and maybe unhappy question, but also selfishly feed and plug my own talk for Explore DVD, which is where some tactics when you don't control the teams, you don't control the stakeholders, what the staffing looks like, who you get to hire, What are some actual tactics that you can can do to influence the situation when these two service teams have never ever talked to each other even though they're in the same.


Speaker:  22:58
Federal agency or company? What do you do in those cases?


Speaker:  22:58
Elizabeth.


Speaker:  22:59
Picking up the watch.


Speaker:  22:59
So I think there's one tactic that I've seen work really, really well and that's throw people at it. Like, if you have the wrong boundary, that is going to be a high price on the people who have to then navigate that boundary and build the bridges. Like personally to, like, yeah, to counter the fact that you've actually just got a wrong boundary in the 1st place. But there are times when you really, like, legally cannot actually shift a particular boundary. And so it can make sense to do this. Unfortunately, this needs to be a really great person. Like they need to be really technically aware and able to communicate.


Speaker:  22:59
Super well on both. Like I think it's it's a really big problem, so very expensive.


Speaker:  23:00
Problem. But you can solve it. It's just it's gonna take human power to be able to navigate that boundary. And so if you can possibly find a way to shift that and make the case for a better team structure, as you know understanding things like minimizing handoffs or you know decreasing blocking dependencies or whatever that is that that thing that maybe your stakeholders can understand is why the rebel those boundaries like maybe some education that can help but if you can't do it then.


Speaker:  23:00
It's gonna take people. It's gonna take great people.


Speaker:  23:00
If anyone owns a better answer like, I'd love to hear it too.


Speaker:  23:00
In in all seriousness there there's the work world, but then there's invite them out after work and.


Speaker:  23:00
Have drinks and stuff. Like there's a lot that can be done. I think with just getting people together and you're not you're not forcing barriers to be broken down. But basic camaraderie across teams is a seed that you can get started and and you can usually do that without a lot of permission and then that may help over time and start to see it doesn't make it but you can't really control those things or maybe some things you can't control like hey, let's organize a fun event to go do as a team or and invite them along. There's some of the some of those things that perhaps are.


Speaker:  23:01
100% agree with what you said there Brian. That was also I was going to touch on that topic. I tried to fight these things with facts and logic before talking about things like serious constraints.


Speaker:  23:01
But the harder you push, the more it just seems like the arsenal gets stronger. And actually what I noticed in my career was there are people who are good at this, and those are the kind of people who just seem to get on with everyone, people who just trust them. I'm like, why can't I be like that?


Speaker:  23:01
So I think yeah, on like just small tips.


Speaker:  23:01
Just try and find if you can't go for drinks and stuff after work, just take any excuse to people that you are working with but you don't normally talk to. Just take any excuse that small talk I mentioned earlier.


Speaker:  23:01
Stuff I hate is actually really useful.


Speaker:  23:02
And it's fine, yeah. Just totally agree with Brian. Basically just trying to work on the social level, trying to get them to at least not hate you and then like you and then trust you a bit. And then a lot of magic can happen there once you get to that trust level.


Speaker:  23:02
And can I ask you this, because I I will say that this has been.


Speaker:  23:02
I've gotten hurt, hurt trying to do what you're what you're talking about because often this is the the the power and control structure in an organization. Like there's a reason that that people behave the way that they're behaving and So what are your what has what have you found that that works or moves you in the right direction.


Speaker:  23:02
I think there's a lot of what people have said today. It's bringing to other groups that haven't previously talked to each other, may not even know each other exist.


Speaker:  23:03
I've heard of the analogy of people when I first got into government, that you don't understand how big the government is or how small of a cog you are. You're literally on a you're on a battleship, right? There's thousands of people on this battleship, and you only talk to a handful of them. But yeah, definitely being able to build bridges.


Speaker:  23:03
As well as Lisa said, there's sometimes you can't cross boundaries, sometimes there are there are hard boundaries that you can't cross them.


Speaker:  23:03
But oftentimes I'm not. Oftentimes if they haven't, they're incomplete or something descriptions or like attuned to everyone who recently saw an evening of drinks and 10 pin bowling Working really well to build relationships between teams based in different countries are things that you know when we, when we work in Medicare, that's 2% of GDP. You don't want to move fast and break things like that doesn't help with what you do in Medicare when so many doctors and so many.


Speaker:  23:03
You know, folks depend on that for their health care.


Speaker:  23:04
That's not something you want to you Just Dance around or take off people either. But those things are built in. So I think accepting it, learning how to build the bridges, finding the commonalities.


Speaker:  23:04
But I think what other people is that I know what people, what makes people tick, right? So what is the, what is the metric each person cares about? Can we align those metrics? Often times it's not often time someone's like I need to move X number of widgets.


Speaker:  23:04
Pay for X number of widgets over here and they don't align with each other or different widgets. But yeah, I think it's a lot of what people said.


Speaker:  23:04
People outside of work and try to bring them together, try to facilitate conversations with each other and.


Speaker:  23:04
You know it doesn't always work. It doesn't always work.


Speaker:  23:05
Your building trust takes time, right? And then so it's like you you have to have your collaborations and and trust built in first before you can move the mail. So that's kind of like what I've I've learned. I've tried to go fast and and then I get nowhere because I don't have those relationships, but over a little period of time after I've gotten to understand people and after they've had a chance to know me better.


Speaker:  23:05
Then I think we build on that trust.


Speaker:  23:05
In. Yeah, so in in there are some situations where I felt like I'm this is not a good fit for me. I was trying to get the company in the second direction and.


Speaker:  23:05
He said. Diana, I've gotten a heart, but we shouldn't. Like, I tried to tell the company, like, hey.


Speaker:  23:05
These are the things that the vendor should build for us. We shouldn't spend our time. We should spend our time solving business problems for us, not building these infrastructure type stuff.


Speaker:  23:06
And I hit that hard block and it was became like a power thing. I'm not gonna do that because you told me that. So you know then it gets kind of hard and you know I had to make a a tough choice and figure out is this the space for me or. And then I ended up leaving the company because just didn't you know it didn't work and I had to safeguard my mental health so.


Speaker:  23:06
So there's uh uh, you know this, this, of course you you do your best and also see if if this is something that you want. Of course, I totally understand. You know, I wasn't a position of privilege and and lucky to be in position that I could actually leave and find a new opportunity.


Speaker:  23:06
So yeah.


Speaker:  23:06
I think this is a terrific segue to kind of probably our final submitted question before we turn it up to audience questions, but.


Speaker:  23:07
Looking at each other's background, it looks like five of us are working from home right now.


Speaker:  23:07
Ryan, correctly. That's just like a really nice office with a fire alarm behind you. But you know, we've been working from home, we know that.


Speaker:  23:07
You know, doing an event storm over Zoom, although not ideal, has come the necessity at times. During the last couple of years I've done my fair share of event storms on on Fig Jam and Nero. But also just how do we support ourselves? How do we support each other? How do we?


Speaker:  23:07
We've lost body language, right? If we don't really know what the person, especially in the organizations where cameras are on right? The power dynamics are even harder than navigate when you're simply got from here on up with folks.


Speaker:  23:07
How do we support each other? How do we support ourselves in these kind of difficult situations where we're navigating?


Speaker:  23:07
Team Organizations Client.


Speaker:  23:07
Boundaries. How do we support ourselves and keep ourselves healthy in these situations?


Speaker:  23:08
I'm not pick on someone here and do you look like you're deep in thought I'm gonna interrupt.


Speaker:  23:08
Oh, wait, you did call on me. Oh Gee, OK.


Speaker:  23:08
So.


Speaker:  23:08
I've been working remotely.


Speaker:  23:08
Oh man, more than 10 years. Uh, even before COVID. So it's I first worked remotely for fully distributed companies. So we all had our cameras on and one thing the company did was like have a meet up once or twice a year where we all got together and got to know each other. It was like one week of like we all meet in one part of the world, get to know each other so that you know.


Speaker:  23:08
Is helpful but.


Speaker:  23:09
I also now work for like this like times and we have like maybe once a quarter the remote employees like we we have a group based gathering so that that that is like I find that so amazingly.


Speaker:  23:09
And to preserve my mental peace, I've learned to.


Speaker:  23:09
Go hiking or climbing my weekends like I Saturdays are my secret time. No dog, never kids, just just me and what I like to do.


Speaker:  23:09
So that has also been helping me bring my whole self to work or whatever.


Speaker:  23:09
Any other takers on this one?


Speaker:  23:09
I know this is a tough question.


Speaker:  23:10
8 For me, I'm trying to say it because it's not a negative thing, but only negative things necessarily come to mind, but it's.


Speaker:  23:10
I I really thought that I could.


Speaker:  23:10
I thought that I had more influence and early in my career than I actually do. And what I discovered, but it took me a long time to discover, is people are perfectly happy to let you work yourself to death trying to build these bridges, that they never have any intention of really changing their own minds about what's happening.


Speaker:  23:10
Elizabeth and I have had discussions about this, what I call glue rolls or these, but like where your job is to keep herding cats.


Speaker:  23:11
Keep herding cats, Keep herding cats, Keep herding cats, Keep putting together things that don't wanna be together. And I was interviewed for a podcast sometime in the last couple of years and this question came up and I said no one gets to be a cat.


Speaker:  23:11
That's that is my new mantra. Nobody gets to be a cat.


Speaker:  23:11
That we need, I think, to shift away from this idea that it can be an integrators role or a manager's role or a leadership role to change people's minds, but only each individual can change their mind. So how do we develop systems that create that opportunity for people, right, that move us out of power and control and into opportunities, but in terms of taking care of myself?


Speaker:  23:11
For me it was a lot about.


Speaker:  23:11
Acknowledging in myself when I was doing too much.


Speaker:  23:11
And for little return on that investment and get better at.


Speaker:  23:12
Investing myself where movement could happen, where people were legitimately trying to solve hard problems, they just don't know how and that was OK and.


Speaker:  23:12
Also that I'm recovering from COVID. It's been almost a month and I'm still not recovered and this is because in 2023.


Speaker:  23:12
I tried to just do everything, do everything, do everything. So I am.


Speaker:  23:12
The worst person at learning this lesson over 20 years and I still really haven't learned it. But this balance of recovering your energy and investing it wisely I I really think because this industry, especially if you have a predilection to over over help.


Speaker:  23:12
It'll burn you out really easily. Easy, easy, easy.


Speaker:  23:13
Very much agree with that. I also at least want to give a shout out to the importance of the team in this, you know, and I don't just meeting the people in your organizational hierarchy. I mean the people that you do have that nurturing relationship with a trust bond with and they're able to have something generated come out of that relationship. And that's really critical. We cannot do this alone in the remote context separates us so effectively and remove so many social tools like you said John, that I think it's really important for us to to, you know, really focus on the places where we do have that.


Speaker:  23:13
Thing that we need to be able to do the storage through our work. So I think the team is a really critical concept and so much of our scripture team but like the actual team team at work.


Speaker:  23:14
I don't want to interrupt this drug because we're in a really good place right now, but I did want to post the link. We promised that one attendee would have a chance to win a workshop ticket to end doing this. Workshop. As for DVD, I posted a link to a Google doc. There we're going to randomly select. We're going to leave it open for a few more minutes until another 10 minutes or so, just to let people answer that. There is a trivial question in there. You're going to have to answer the trivia question and nail that question.


Speaker:  23:14
And then we'll add you to the random drawing. But yeah, please click on that and fill that in. But Elizabeth, I want to pick that back up again.


Speaker:  23:14
Just the team. So I'm going to step out of the moderator role just for a second here, but being able to create that psychological safety and you know.


Speaker:  23:14
Evidence talks about, you know, the anti corruption layer. I'm going to call it the anti corruption layer for teams, right, that sometimes we can't control what happens outside the boundary of our teams, but our our local control of the people that we deal with day-to-day was the the people of processing boundaries. We can act as individuals to accept electrical safety.


Speaker:  23:15
Umm, you know, and and push everything else out. Like, yeah, there's these people that resisted to change. Those always exist or people that want to continue working status quo or people that want Kubernetes because it's not in their toolbox quite yet. We can still create psychological safety for ourselves, for our teammates and even people just a step or two outside of that, whether they're their clients or their coworkers. And I've found that that has worked for me tremendously well with that. That way you can create this bubble of safety.


Speaker:  23:15
And that has been something I've valued, an advanced team. Other people do a really good job of creating those environments as well.


Speaker:  23:15
Dogs.


Speaker:  23:15
Dogs.


Speaker:  23:16
Doug. They're Doug. And what I learned during what I learned during COVID is don't forget snarky sci-fi novels or whatever that is to you. Like, it's so because we love this, we tend to also do it as our hobby. And then I forget, you know, I need to play an Xbox for an entire afternoon or read like, you know, being a geek isn't just about what we do at work. This is also the stuff we do for fun. Like. Right. And to remember to have fun. Or Elizabeth. We can't see it now, but games. Oh my gosh. She has the most beautiful game collection. It's so like I it's just.


Speaker:  23:16
This work of art behind, but that's the thing that I forget so easily is like, remember when we were younger and we didn't get paid this and worried about our mortgage and we thought this stuff was fun? We did it, 'cause it was fun.


Speaker:  23:16
Like trying to remember to have some of that still in our lives where we're having fun with with this world, yeah.


Speaker:  23:16
Into how you're feeling. Do we want to open it up and let people go on camera and mute and ask any other questions? Or we could just enjoy each other's company from the last 14 minutes?


Speaker:  23:17
I think we can open it up. The only reason sincere apology is very good and closing this was. I never used to close this. Participants were always you know open to unmute and ask questions. Last meet up with Randy Shu. It was a God. It was a disaster. I thought Zoom bombed. It was just.


Speaker:  23:17
It was so stressful.


Speaker:  23:17
It never felt so stressful as a meet up organizer in all my life and for like that meet up. So that's why we went through all of this security stuff. So I'm happy to.


Speaker:  23:17
Remove that.


Speaker:  23:17
Yeah. So here we go. So people should be able to unmute and ask any other questions you have.
