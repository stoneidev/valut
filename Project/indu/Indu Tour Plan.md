I created the following itinerary for your visit to Korea. I've tried to include things to eat since you're a vegetarian, and I've included some mountain walks since you like mountains. I hope you realize that the time plan below is just a "plan". We should apply "Plan to learn, Learn to plan" not only to software development but also to traveling. 

## Plan 1(Bukhansan National Park)

### 08:30 Incheon International Airport

If you arrive at the airport at 7:30, it will probably take you an hour to find your luggage and clear immigration. Then you can expect to meet me around 8:30. I will have a car with me and we can use it for transportation afterward.
### 09:30~10:30 breakfast

It takes two hours to get from the airport to your hotel. You know you'll be hungry in the morning, so you've been looking for a tofu restaurant near the airport. You've been told you're a vegetarian. The tofu place is no problem. 
### 10:30 ~ 12:00 Move to Bukhansan

### 12:00 ~ 13:00 Bukhansan

I've never been to Bukhansan either. There is a hiking trail to the top of the mountain, but there is also a very well organized walking trail that goes around the perimeter of the mountain (you should check it out). We will arrive at the entrance to the trail at around 12:00. The hike to the top of Bukhansan takes about an hour, depending on the route. If you consider it a round trip, it will take about 2 to 3 hours, so I think it's a good idea to walk around the perimeter for about an hour and have a meal.  There are some good cafes and restaurants near the trailhead, so you can grab a bite to eat or a cup of coffee right after your walk.
### 13:00 ~ 14:00 Lunch

There is a village at the foot of Bukhansan Mountain with many restaurants. Here you can choose whatever you want. Since the restaurants are located at the bottom of the mountain, there are a lot of shops that sell food that Koreans eat after hiking. 
### 14:00 ~ 15:00 Coffee

There are a variety of cafes with stunning views of Bukhansan Mountain. Among them, I think this hanok-turned-cafe is the best fit for this trip. It is also used as a filming location for many K-dramas. It's a great place to visit after your meal. The Bukhansan branch of Starbucks also has a great view.

The house you see in the picture is the former residence of South Korea's presidents. The mountain behind it is Bukhansan, which is where we are going. It is much closer to the city than Bukhansan. There are a total of four trails, which take between 40 minutes and 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete. Bukhaksan is not far from the center of Seoul, and Gwangjang Market is not far away, so you can easily eat tteokbokki.  

In 1968, North Korean guerrillas used Bukhaksan Mountain to storm the Blue House, so the trail was closed to the public for 54 years. Today, of course, you can use it peacefully.
### 13:00 ~ 13:30 Move to Gwangjang Market

This place really doesn't need any more explanation. Probably every street food you can eat in Korea is there. I think you mentioned tteokbokki before, but there's a huge variety of tteokbokki, as well as souvenirs, other things. 

### 14:30 ~ 15:30 Coffee
It's just everything in there.
### 16:00 Hotel

### 10:30 ~ 11:15 Move to Haengjusanseong Fortress
### 11:15 ~ 12:15 Goyang Haengjusanseong Historical Park Trail

Korea has been invaded by many foreign nations. In 1593, there was a big battle here at Haengjusanseong Fortress with the Japanese who invaded Korea. We won, of course. There is a scenic view overlooking the Han River here, and there are trails that you can walk around for about two hours.

### 12:15 ~ 13:15 Lunch

This noodle soup makes for a quick lunch. With the Han River bike path nearby, this noodle shop is very popular with many cyclists. As you can see from the photos in the blog below, this noodle shop has been around for a long time and is very popular with Koreans.

###  13:15 ~ 14:15 Coffee

Cafe TenNine

We found a nice cafe where you can eat noodles and have a cup of coffee overlooking the Han River. There are many other cafes near Haengjusanseong Fortress with great views.

### 10: 30 Move with Snacks
For this course, we're not going to be spending the morning near the airport, so we're going to have a quick snack along the way and then drive into Seoul for about 2 hours. 

### 10:30 ~ 11:30 Late breakfast
Here's the same tofu menu as the one near the airport (introduced by Jungmee).

### 11:30 ~ 13:00 Acha Mountain

The entire Acha Mountain walk is a two- to three-hour course. From here, you can see all of Seoul.
