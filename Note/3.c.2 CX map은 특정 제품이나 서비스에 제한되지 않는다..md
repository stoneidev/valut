Customer Experience Mapping is a lot more comprehensive than customer journey mapping. **The major difference between a customer experience map and a customer journey map is that the customer experience map isnâ€™t limited to a single sale or even one product. A customer experience map covers all touchpoints whether or not they resulted in a sale whereas a customer journey pertains only to a single sale and the steps that were involved in it.**

A customer experience map, or CEM, is a measurement of the customer's overall experience with a product, service, or brand, from the initial discovery phase up to the purchase phase, where a lead commits to becoming a customer. Unlike a journey map, the experience map focuses on an overall multi-channel experience and includes elements such as customer reviews, support, satisfaction, references or referrals, and price concerns.

A customer experience map can help a company understand how the customer felt about the process of becoming a customer from an initial lead. The company might consider specific feelings about parts of the process and heavily consider the customer's perspective on the price, value, and practicality of the product or service the business offers.
